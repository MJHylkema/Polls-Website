# Polls Website

This app was made by myself, Mathew Hylkema for SENG365 assignment 2. It is a simple MVVM web application for viewing voting polls. It makes use of AngularJS to provide a interactive, responsive front end client and RESTful web services for all database related requests.

This website uses Bootstrap for almost all of it's css. I chose to use bootstrap as it provides a tidy design while being easy to implement. I implemented a background image to give the website a stylish look. For the navbar implementation, I based it off an example on the bootstrap website.
